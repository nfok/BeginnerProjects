# BeginnerProjects
These are some simple projects that I have worked on previously.

### Gradebook Average Calculator
This program simply opens a gradebook, which should be a .txt file, and then asks for three inputs: numbers of scores for each student, number of students, and number of courses. The program then calculates the average grade of the student and gives a letter grade to them according to this cutoff:
100-90 A
89-80 B
79-70 C
69-60 D
59-0 F
As of right now, the number of courses input does nothing as I never ended up adding that functionality to the program.

### HTML Calculator
Very primitive calculator that only has four basic operations: multiplication, division, addition, subtraction. Additional buttons can easily be added, but this is more to showcase basic understanding of front end skills.
